# BigQuery Schemas

This file briefly describes the bigquery schemas included in the current folder.

### cts_raw_run.json
This table contains one row per buildbot run of a CTS test. The row contains
identifying information about the run -- cts test branch, emulator branch, total
number of test passes etc.

'uuid' is an important field that is (ahem) guaranteed to be unique in the table
for each row. This field is used as a foreign key from other tables described
below, although BigQuery does not itself have the notion of foreign key.

### cts_raw_results.json
This table contains the result of each individual CTS test, run as part of the
CTS suite on the CTS bot. The 'f_uuid' column keys into the 'cts_raw_run'
table to identify the CTS run that the row belongs to.

### cts_flakiness_summary.json
This table contains one row per buildbot run of a CTS test. The row contains the
same context information as 'cts_raw_run' and 'f_uuid' indeed is a foreign key
into that table. We duplicate the context information in this table to allow
downstream dashboards to easily filter summaries based on the context.

### cts_flakiness_results.json
This table contains per CTS test flakiness information for every buildbot CTS
run. 'f_uuid' keys into 'cts_raw_run' to identify the buildbot CTS run that a
row corresponds to.
